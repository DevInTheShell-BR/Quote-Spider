# Quote-Spider
A simple Splash-Scrapy project to extract quotes from [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com)

This project shows how to scrape pages with content generated by JavaScript. It's a commom situation to deal with when we want to scrape data from websites.

The project uses Splash, a lightweight web browser, to get the content generated by JavaScript rendered. It also uses Scrapy to extract the data from the pages rendered by Splash.
